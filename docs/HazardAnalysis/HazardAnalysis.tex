\section{Introduction}

This document is dedicated as a hazard analysis of the GenreGuru music system. The GenreGuru software is designed to aid its users with their consumption and creation of music, doing so by providing song analysis, recommendation, and music generation services. As such, we define a hazard as a potential malfunction in the system, either due to internal factors (such as the training data, defects in the software) or external factors (such as user inputs).

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The purpose of hazard analysis for this project is to determine points and causes of failure in the system. \textcolor{red}{\sout{This includes their effects and considering mitigation methods.}} \textcolor{red}{This includes analyzing the effects of potential failures and devising appropriate mitigation strategies.} Here are some brief types of loss we expect hazards could incur: \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compromised Data -- such as corruption of the training dataset/outputs.
    \item Project History -- improper GitHub merging causing portions of documentation to vanish.
    \item User Experience Loss -- generated recommendations/snippets do not satisfy user needs.
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{\sout{Note that traditional/physical hazards are not applicable in a pure software system.}} \textcolor{red}{It is important to note that traditional physical hazards (e.g., fires, explosions, mechanical failures) are not applicable in a pure software system such as this.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{It is assumed that the user will not attempt to exploit system vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the components of the system.}} \\
    \textcolor{red}{It is assumed that users will not intentionally misuse or attempt to break the system.}
    \item It is assumed that users will have the physical capabilities to interact with the system. \textcolor{red}{(Specifically, users are expected to have adequate visual acuity, fine motor control, and familiarity with input devices such as keyboards, mice, or touchscreens. Additionally, users must have access to hardware (e.g., a computer or smartphone) that meets the minimum display, processing, and connectivity requirements specified in the user documentation.)}
    \item It is assumed that all libraries used in development are \textcolor{red}{\sout{validated and tested.}} \textcolor{red}{validated and tested, where validation involves verifying that each library meets its documented functional and non-functional requirements (including API contracts and dependency compatibility), and testing involves comprehensive unit, integration, and regression tests to ensure stability and correct behavior under expected conditions.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
    
    The majority of the team was involved in collaborating to complete all sections of the deliverable together, as opposed to appointing different sections to different people. As a result, we engaged in a deep discussion regarding project scope and system components, prompting us to restrict our scope to just the featurization component, making the music recommendation and generation components stretch goals.

    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?
    
    Because the team was heavily engaged in collaborative completion of the document, there repeatedly were extended conversations during which we refined project scope, but also lost focus -- the loss of focus resulted in the deliverable taking a longer time to complete than would have otherwise been necessary.

    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how did they come about?
    
    We fortunately were thorough in our consideration of hazards and risks while drafting prior deliverables. As a result, section 15 of our SRS document had considerable coverage except for two integrity requirements concerning data accuracy and persistence. When considering the server storage component of the system, we noted that there was no guarantee of data correctness or persistence should a server failure occur. As a result, we included IR1 and IR2 to capture these risks.

    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in software products. Why are they important to consider?
    
    Two types of risks in software products that aren't related to physical are: the risk of compromising (user or software) data, and scope creep, where the software uncontrollably grows and developers commit to adding features beyond what was intially agreed to.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Data compromise is crucial to consider because user and application data can be very sensitive, e.g., users often reuse their credentials, thus said data being compromised could have far-reaching effects beyond just the user's ability to interact with the service. Company Data can also be very valuable, if it is exposed it could be used by competitors or used to exploit other vulnerabilities within the software. Compromising unreleased songs can also result in legal action being carried out against the devlopment team.
        \item Scope creep is important to consider because it arises when the project is not properly  defined during early planning stages. This often leads to extra developement work and accrual of costs for features that might not work properly or are unecessary for project success.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
