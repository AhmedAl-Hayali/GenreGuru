### Problem Statement
#### Checklist
##### Clear scope
##### Abstract document - no programming language, no algorithm choice
##### Output is unambiguous
##### Inputs are unambiguous
##### Simplicity (no need for ToC)
##### Clearly-identified stakeholders
##### Clearly-identified environment
##### Problem importance convincingly stated
##### Goals (measurable) outline product's selling features
#### Problem
Most games lack various crucial components that prevent them from being truly memorable. Our goal is to fix that by producing a fun, engaging, rewarding and challenging experience for players to either push their skill to the limit or enjoy a more casual experience
#### Inputs & Outputs
Inputs will be mouse and keyboard. Ouput will be the game rendering on a monitor at high FPS without stuttering
#### Stakeholders
Gamers, both hardcore and casual, will provide valuable feedback for various aspects of the game (balance issues, graphical tweaks, etc)
#### Environment
Game will run natively in Windows
### Goals
- Game will contain infinite procedurally generated levels, allowing for endless fun
- Levels will have mechanics that both hinder and help the player
- Difficulty will increase as the levels are completed
- Rewards need to improve with the difficulty curve
- Completion of each level will provide the player the option to improve their build with points they earned from previous levels
- A wide variety of enemies that will provide unique gameplay mechanics that will require the player to think on their feet to overcome
- Isometric perspective from some of the most popular roguelike games
- Every few levels there will be a special boss level that will act as a skill check for players that want to push themselves further
### Stretch Goals
- Controller Support
- Code-based multiplayer matchmaking
### Challenge Level (advanced, general, or basic) & Extras (2)
General
#### Challenge level contributors: domain knowledge, implementation, novelty.
Contributers will mainly come in the form of domain knowledge (people who play games a lot)
#### Extras (2): usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking.
- Usability testing will be the main source of feedback that we use to make design decisions for the final product. It will be incredibly extensive
- User documentation will come in the form of a comprehensive tutorial that introduces the player to the controls and mechanics of the game
