## Videogame
### Problem Statement
#### Checklist
##### Clear scope
A locally run game that contains infinite procedurally generated levels, each with their own mechanics, along with a meaningful difficulty and reward progression system, all rendered from an isometric perspective
##### Abstract document - no programming language, no algorithm choice
There are hardly any games that have the three crucial pillars of a great game. We hope to create one that has all three:
- a satisfying and responsive gameplay loop
- A meaningful progression system for both rewards and difficulty
- An incentive for players to continue playing the game
##### Output is unambiguous
The game is responsively rendered on the monitor at high FPS and no stuttering
##### Inputs are unambiguous
Mouse and keyboard controls
##### Simplicity (no need for ToC)
Game will be very simple without a large learning curve. There will be only a few controls the player will have to learn
##### Clearly-identified stakeholders
Friends who play video games a lot (they're friends so i'm refraining from putting their names here, I will if required)
##### Clearly-identified environment
The game will be supported on Windows 7 and above
##### Problem importance convincingly stated
A great game requires the following pillars:
- Rewarding and satisfying gameplay
- A system that rewards the player through playing
- An incentive for the player to continue playing

Most games are hyped up to have all three pillars yet they always fall significantly short. This builds distrust between the developers and the playerbase, causing players to abandon the game en masse, making the game "dead".

The industry needs a game that delivers on its promises that also has a rock-solid foundation for each of the three pillars described above.
##### Goals (measurable) outline product's selling features
- Game will contain infinite procedurally generated levels, allowing for endless fun
- Levels will have mechanics that both hinder and help the player
- Difficulty will increase as the levels are completed
- Rewards need to improve with the difficulty curve
- Completion of each level will provide the player the option to improve their build with points they earned from previous levels
- A wide variety of enemies that will provide unique gameplay mechanics that will require the player to think on their feet to overcome
- Isometric perspective from some of the most popular roguelike games
- Every few levels there will be a special boss level that will act as a skill check for players that want to push themselves further
#### Problem
Most games lack various crucial components that prevent them from being truly memorable. Our goal is to fix that by producing a fun, engaging, rewarding and challenging experience for players to either push their skill to the limit or enjoy a more casual experience
#### Inputs & Outputs
Inputs will be mouse and keyboard, controller. Ouput will be the game rendering on a monitor
#### Stakeholders
Gamers, both hardcore and casual, will provide valuable feedback for various aspects of the game (balance issues, graphical tweaks, etc)
#### Environment
Game will run natively in Windows
### Goals
- Smooth rendering at high FPS and no stuttering
- Meaningful reward system
- Balanced difficulty progression
- Responsive and rewarding gameplay loop
### Stretch Goals
- Controller Support
- Code-based multiplayer matchmaking
### Challenge Level (advanced, general, or basic) & Extras (2)
General
#### Challenge level contributors: domain knowledge, implementation, novelty.
Contributers will mainly come in the form of domain knowledge (people who play games a lot)
#### Extras (2): usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking.
- Usability testing will be the main source of feedback that we use to make design decisions for the final product. It will be incredibly extensive
- User documentation will come in the form of a comprehensive tutorial that introduces the player to the controls and mechanics of the game
