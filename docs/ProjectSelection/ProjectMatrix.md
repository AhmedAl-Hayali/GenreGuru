## Criteria Dictionary
* **Feasibility**: *Likelihood of completing the project to an adequate level.*
* **Real-world impact**
* **Productive in Industry**: *Improvement in speed or quality of completion of relevant problem.*
* **Productive Personally**: *Roughly quantified learning outcome - is this a good use of 8 months, and will it help secure a job?*
* **Economic Impact**: *Does this make money?*
* **Socially Responsible**: *What harm does can/does this project inflict - may be useful to run this after stakeholder identification*
* **Interesting Computationally**: *Will implemented mechanics/algorithms/computations be challenging and/or fulfilling to create, or will it be simple/tedious?*
* **Impressive Computationally**: *Will others, be they naïve or informed, find mechanics/algorithms/computations impressive/cool?*
* **Interesting Data**: *Will consumed/continuously processed data be challenging and/or fulfilling to integrate, or will it be simple/tedious?*
* **Impressive Data**: *Will others, be they naïve or informed, find consumed/continuously processed data impressive/cool?*
* **Interesting System Integration**: *Will the project have several sub-systems/components that interact, making it challenging and/or fulfilling to integrate, or will it be simple?*
* **Impressive Documentation Process**: *Will others, be they naïve or informed, find the documentation impressive/cool? (Or will they fall asleep reading something that's hard to pick up?)*
* **Interesting to Develop**: *Will implementing mechanics/algorithms/computations, integrating data and sub-systems/components be challenging and/or fulfilling, or will it be simple/tedious?*
* **Interesting Infrastructure**: *Will deploying the project be challenging and/or fulfilling, or will it be simple/tedious?*
* **Impressive Infrastructure**: *Will others, be they naïve or informed, find the <u>deployed</u> project more impressive/cool than a non-deployed project?*
* **Supervisor(s)/Stakeholder(s) Availability**: *Will (a) supervisor(s) and/or quality stakeholder(s) be often-accessible for consultation?*
