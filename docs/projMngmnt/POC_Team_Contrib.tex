\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=0cm]
    \item[Demonstration] Our reduced-scope demonstration should illustrate the ability to acquire data programmatically, i.e., accessing \texttt{MP3} files from \href{https://developers.deezer.com/api}{Deezer} or \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api}{Spotify}'s APIs, and producing a single musical feature of the song, e.g., pitch, timbre, or whatever other feature is found to be representative of songs and relatively easy to implement.
    \item[Post-demonstration] A successful demonstration will allow us to later scale up our data ingestion to satisfy multiple users' requests automatically, and provide songs' musical features on demand, expanding the available features incrementally. If the featurization/feature engineering component works correctly, a song recommendation component can later be integrated by using song features as distance metrics.

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

We have chosen not to conduct any formal supervisor or stakeholder meetings yet due to the fragile scope of the project that was shrunk during the hazard analysis. Proceeding forward, there should be more structure to and confidence in the project so stakeholder engagement will be more frequent, i.e., approximately bi-weekly.
