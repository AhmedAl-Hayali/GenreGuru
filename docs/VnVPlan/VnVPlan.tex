\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.
Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem
statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the
course instructor.  You can use a pull request to update your challenge level
(in TeamComposition.csv or Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the
VnV planning exercise.}

\wss{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.
You can use a pull request to update your extras (in TeamComposition.csv or
Repos.csv) if your plan changes as a result of the VnV planning exercise.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.  You can create BibTeX entries for your
  documents and within those entries include a hyperlink to the documents.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
The following approaches will be used for SRS verification:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Formal reviews with the supervisor
  \item A checklist that will be given to the supervisor and any peer reviewers. It will also
  serve as a guide for the developers of the system
  \item Using feedback from grading to create new checklists and update existing checklists
  \item Ad-hoc reviews from peers and other teams in the course
\end{itemize}
This is the initial SRS checklist that reviewers will use. It will be updated as reviews are performed:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[$\square$] Does each functional requirement have a detailed and accurate description, rationale and fit criteria?
  \item[$\square$] Is each requirement (both functional and non-functional) relevant and necessary?
  \item[$\square$] Are all functional requirements traceable to at least one use case?
  \item[$\square$] Are all fit critera unambiguous and verifiable?
  \item[$\square$] Have all issues opened by reviewers been closed? 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The design verification will ensure that each component of the system meets the requirements outlined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS). Verification will occur through systematic reviews, testing, and validation checklists tailored to each component.

\subsubsection{Client Application Design Verification}
User-facing component for inputting track information and displaying system output.
\begin{description}
  \item[Verification Approach] The verification will proceed as we:
  
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0cm]
    \item Conduct usability testing with users to assess ease of input and clarity of output.
    \item Review design documents to ensure UI/UX aligns with requirements.
  \end{itemize}
  \item[Checklist] The design is considered verified if the:
  
    \begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=0cm]
    \item User can input track information without errors.
    \item System output is clear and comprehensible.
    \item User feedback is collected and assessed.
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Server Networking Design Verification}
Represents communication between the server and external components, e.g., between the client application and external service APIs.
\begin{description}
  \item[Verification Approach] The verification will proceed as we:
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0cm]
    \item Review network architecture to confirm it supports required protocols.
    \item Test for successful data transmission between components.
  \end{itemize}
  \item[Checklist] The design is considered verified if:
    \begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=0cm]
    \item All intended connections are established.
    \item Data loss during transmission is within acceptable limits.
    \item Network security measures are implemented and verified.
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Server Compute Design Verification}
Component responsible for processing user requests and issuing featurization and data access requests.
\begin{description}
  \item[Verification Approach] The verification will proceed as we:
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0cm]
    \item Review processing algorithms for efficiency.
    \item Conduct code reviews to ensure best practices are followed.
  \end{itemize}
  \item[Checklist] The design is considered verified if the:
    \begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=0cm]
    \item Processing time is optimized for expected load.
    \item Code is clean and adheres to project standards.
    \item Edge cases are handled appropriately.
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Server Storage Design Verification}
Represents the database for storing data.
\begin{description}
  \item[Verification Approach] The verification will proceed as we:
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0cm]
    \item Review database schema against the SRS.
    \item Test data retrieval and storage for accuracy.
  \end{itemize}
  \item[Checklist] The design is considered verified if the:
    \begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=0cm]
    \item Schema supports all required data types and relationships.
    \item Data retrieval times meet performance criteria.
    \item Data integrity is maintained during transactions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{External Service APIs Design Verification}
Represents integration with external services like Spotify or Deezer.
\begin{description}
  \item[Verification Approach] The verification will proceed as we:
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0cm]
    \item Review API documentation for compliance.
    \item Test integration for successful data exchange.
  \end{itemize}
  \item[Checklist] The design is considered verified if:
    \begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=0cm]
    \item All API endpoints are functional as expected.
    \item Data that is exchanged is accurate and formatted correctly.
    \item Error handling for API failures is in place.
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Featurizer Design Verification}
Handles the featurization process.
\begin{description}
  \item[Verification Approach] The verification will proceed as we:
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0cm]
    \item Review featurization algorithms for correctness.
    \item Test output against known input cases to validate accuracy.
  \end{itemize}
  \item[Checklist] The design is considered verified if:
    \begin{itemize}[label=$\square$,leftmargin=0cm]
    \item All features are correctly extracted from input data.
    \item Featurization time is within acceptable limits.
    \item Results match expected outputs for test cases.
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

A group discussion will be held bi-weekly to review the verification process and address any outstanding issues. Feedback from classmates will be incorporated throughout the development process, especially during review sessions.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

\wss{This is a section that would be appropriate for some projects.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{This section is not required for CAS 741}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
  We benefited from refining the scope of our Functional Requirements (FRs) in the SRS document, 
  allowing us to focus on relevant test cases. This saved significant time and helped avoid creating test cases 
  for requirements outside of the project's intended scope.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them? \\
  A major challenge was maintaining an abstract perspective when defining test cases for requirements. 
  It was tempting to delve into detailed unit test cases rather than focusing on verification at a broader level. 
  To resolve this, we regularly reviewed each section and discussed ways to keep our approach consistent with high-level testing.

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member. \\
  Muhammad Jawad: To effectively conduct verification and validation, the team needs to develop a solid understanding of 
  dynamic testing techniques and best practices. \\
  Mohamad-Hassan Bahsoun: To successfully complete the verification and validation for GenreGuru, 
  I will need to gain expertise in API testing to ensure that data exchanges between the application and 
  external services are accurate, secure, and reliable.\\
  Matthew: To conduct effective testing through static analysis methods,
  the team will also need to develop a strong understanding of static testing techniques and best practices\\
  Ansel: Ansel will have to learn how to unit testing in order to properly apply the tests that were drafted up in the VnV plan.


  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice? \\
  To gain expertise in dynamic testing, Jawad will:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Perform practice-based learning through testing frameworks such as `pytest`
    \item Watch Youtube tutorials on dynamic testing tools and practices
  \end{itemize}
  This will help ensure basic foundational understanding of dynamic testing techniques.\\
  Matthew will:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Practice integrating \texttt{Ruff} and \texttt{Mypy} into toy projects
    \item Watch videos and reading documentation on best practices for static analysis tools
  \end{itemize}
  Matthew has minimal experience in static analysis tools, so it would be worthwhile to become proficient.\\
  Two approaches for acquiring API testing knowledge include completing online courses or tutorials that cover key API testing principles, or peer learning (e.g. learning from a classmate).
  Mohamad-Hassan Bahsoun has chosen to pursue online tutorials to build foundational skills in a structured, and paced format. This is because this will allow him to be flexible while ensuring he covers essential concepts required for the project’s testing needs.\\
  As stated in section 3.1, Ansel is expected to test the featurizer and client application. 
  For the client application testing, it is expected that Ansel will apply the knowledge from SFWR 4HC3: 
  Human computer interfaces in order to help test and design a client application that is satisfactory. 
  For the featurizer testing, it is expected that Ansel will learn about how to featurize songs and then process that data, 
  which can include reading papers or asking Dr. MvM to learn.
