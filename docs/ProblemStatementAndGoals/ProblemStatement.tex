\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsubsection{Problem Definition}

Current music recommendation systems, such as Spotify, often lack personalization and depth, leading to suboptimal suggestions. Furthermore, the ability to create music typically requires extensive knowledge of instruments, production software, or technical tools, limiting accessibility. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering a platform that allows users to receive tailored music recommendations and generate music without needing specialized training. By simplifying the creation and recommendation process, this platform democratizes music production for both professionals and casual users.

\subsubsection{Problem Importance}

This project holds significant value for a wide range of users. Music recommendation systems have millions of daily users, and improving the quality of recommendations can greatly enhance user satisfaction. Additionally, by providing tools that make music creation more accessible, the project opens creative opportunities for individuals who might otherwise be excluded due to the technical barriers involved in music production. The platform is poised to impact both the music industry and hobbyists, facilitating innovation and creativity in music generation and exploration.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}\\

There are two main components of this project. They are both generative systems, one being a recommendation
system, the other being a pseudo-music generator. There is also a song analysis system, necessary in
order to get the recommendation system and generative systems working as they will most likely operate on 
the data that the song analysis system provides. \\

Inputs:\\
A "track" is defined as a full song. A snippet is defined as a fragment of a track. These are objects that 
contain a sound file and some labels describing the song. 
High-Level: 
For system 1 (recommendation): a list of track(s). \\
For system 2 (music generation): a reference track or snippet. \\
For system 3 (analysis): a singular reference track. \\

Explanation: The main idea behind the inputs is essentially to make them all related to each other as they are
fundamentally connected within the system. This means that roughly, all the files are either lists containing
the track as an object and a snippet is functionally under the hood a track, simply labelled differently for
categorization purposes. This allows the system to share behaviors along the sub systems for 
faster implementation and design. As for format specifically, we can pull these from the spotify API song previews,
API song features. \\

Outputs: \\
For System 1 (recommendation): A list of track(s), indexed with a similarity score. \\
For System 2 (music generation): a snippet. \\
For System 3 (analysis): a breakdown of the main aspects of the track.\\

Explanation: for system 1, it should output a list of recommended tracks and some form of a similarity score
as a way to justify itself. This score could be derived on factors such as genre, sound signature, artist, etc.

For system 2, the snippest is an object containing the sound file. 

For system 3, a score that categorizes the main features of the song, such as the musical range, genre, rythm, etc. \\

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    
\emph{Ansel}
The main disagreements we had were the project selection. To resolve this, we used a project selection matrix 
where we rated the proposed projects by a large amount of criteria and then discussed which projects we felt
were the most interesting, feasible, or doable. We ended up eliminating some projects due to this. We then proceeded to use a strawpoll in order to sort out which
remaining projects were our top choices, and which ones were projects where there was 1 team member who simply was not
interested in at all. This lead us to select the GenreGuru project. The documentation allowed us to neatly organize our
thoughts on each project and to compare them in the most fair and honest method possible. 

We also predicted that editing a latex
document and then resolving conflict through github could be potentially an issue, which we resolved by having each member 
edit one section of the document and then using pull requests to review our changes before having one person handling merging
all our edits into the final .tex file. This helped us stay organized and not cause headaches with merge conflicts. 

    did you resolve them? \\ \\
    \emph{Bahsoun}
    During this deliverable, we anticipated challenges, so we approached the task by dividing the workload among our team. Each member volunteered to focus on a specific section while contributing thoughts during collaborative discussions. After completing our individual sections and reviewing each other's work, we convened for a call to share our feedback on what we liked and what needed adjustments. Overall, while the deliverable went smoothly, we did encounter some pain points. One critical challenge was selecting the right technologies, particularly in determining which frameworks and machine learning libraries to use. To tackle this, each member conducted research to evaluate the strengths of various options, allowing us to narrow down our choices effectively. Another challenge arose from team members' busy schedules, making it difficult to coordinate in-person meetings. To overcome this, we prioritized communication throughout the week, ensuring everyone stayed informed. Instead of requiring everyone to attend every meeting, we arranged for a few members to attend and then relay key points to those who couldn't make it. This approach helped keep the entire team aligned and engaged.

    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
