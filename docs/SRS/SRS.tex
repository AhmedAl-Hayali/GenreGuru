\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \\ \\ 
  As a team, the Rhythm Rangers, we need to acquire a diverse range of knowledge and skills from various domains, including software development, 
  music generation, and collaborative teamwork, to successfully complete our capstone project. Given the scope of this task, it is essential 
  for each team member to focus on specific areas of expertise that align with their skills, passions, roles, and responsibilities, 
  as well as learn new skills and gain new knowledge. Outlined below is the knowledge and skills the team will collectively need to acquire
  to successfully complete this capstone project: 
  \\ \\
  \textbf{Music Analysis and Signal Processing:} This capstone project involves developing expertise in audio signal processing to analyze sound data and extract 
  valuable insights for music recommendation and generation systems. The team will learn to implement machine learning models for tasks such as genre 
  classification and feature extraction. Proficiency in Python libraries for audio analysis and model training is essential. This will deepen the 
  teams understanding of music theory and the connections between song features and genres.
  \\ \\ 
  \textbf{Frontend or Backend Development:} The team will need to understand backend frameworks for building and managing the recommendation system's 
  infrastructure. The will be integrating external APIs to access song previews and features. They will also gain knowledge in database 
  management for storing and organizing song data and user preferences. Furthermore, this involves learning how to scale and efficiently handle data
  for a local server-based system.
  \\ \\
  \textbf{UI/UX and Design:} The team will need to design user-friendly interfaces that ensure smooth interaction with the music recommendation and 
  generation systems. UI/UX design skills will need refinement and utilizization of frontend development frameworks will be needed to craft the systems user 
  interface. They will also learn to connect frontend components with backend APIs for real-time updates, such as delivering song recommendations.
  \\ \\
  \textbf{Music Generation:} An understanding of generative models to create music snippets from input tracks or references will be a huge component for this project. 
  The team will delve into music feature engineering, transforming audio data into usable features for machine learning applications. Familiarity with music data 
  will assist in generating new content and making recommendations.
  \\ \\ 
  \textbf{Team Management and Infrastructure:} For this project to be a success improving project management and team coordination skills will foster effective communication, 
  sprint planning, and task assignment. We will need to learn how to establish and maintain local server infrastructure for efficient hosting and operation of the platform. 
  Understanding security best practices to safeguard user data and ensure the system's resilience against vulnerabilities is critical. Mastery of version control and Git management 
  will promote seamless collaboration and code review among the team.
  \\ \\
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
