\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
\textcolor{red}{\sout{Experimentation in music production is a process driven by intuition, i.e., lacking a core systematic structure, limited by a producer's experience and exposure to complex tools and techniques. \emph{GenreGuru} strives to greatly reduce the effort involved in \emph{methodically} attaining exposure to the use of tools and techniques in other songs. \emph{GenreGuru}, by extension, democratizes access to experimentation in music production to less experienced producers, hobbyist musicians, and novices in music production.}}

\textcolor{red}{Discovering new music that aligns with an individual's unique taste can be overwhelming, especially in todays vast music industry. 
GenreGuru simplifies this process by leveraging a content-based recommendation system. 
Rather than relying on user ratings or external popularity metrics, GenreGuru analyzes the intrinsic features of each song, 
such as spectral characteristics, tempo, and key, to identify and suggest tracks that closely match a user's current favorite. 
This approach empowers casual listeners, hobbyists, and music enthusiasts to effortlessly explore new music that resonates with their preferences, 
transforming the music discovery into a more engaging experience.}

\subsection{Goals of the Project}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{featurize} -- produce tabular features corresponding to characteristics of input songs;}}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{recommend} -- produce a collection of songs similar to input songs;}}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{generate} -- produce an audio artifact similar to input reference songs.}}  
\end{itemize}


\textcolor{red}{The goal of the project is to develop a fast, accurate, and intuitive music recommendation system that leverages detailed audio features to suggest 
tracks closely aligned with a listener’s unique taste. By analyzing intrinsic song characteristics such as spectral properties, tempo, and key, 
GenreGuru delivers personalized recommendations through a user-friendly interface that requires minimal learning effort. 
If successful, this system will enhance personalized music discovery for a broad range of users, fostering deeper engagement with their 
favorite genres.}

\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client} \label{2.1-client}
The project is academic in nature, hence has no formal clients beyond the supervisor, who will be consulted periodically to direct project effort.
\subsection{Customer} \label{2.2-customer}
Please refer to \ref{2.3-other-stakeholders} and \ref{2.4-hands-on-users} for the current characterization of candidate customers. Section \ref{2.5-personas} will more succinctly specify archetypal customers after candidate customer interviews are carried out.
\subsection{Other Stakeholders} \label{2.3-other-stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) -- \emph{To protect the privacy of our stakeholders, SMEs are completely deidentified with the exception of the user group they fall into, if applicable. Were this to be a commercial project, we acknowledge that we would have to, under jurisdiction of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, abide by The \href{https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/}{Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)}. Further, we have elected, for the interim, not to include a formal conflict resolution agreement as stakeholders' interests will be considered only under discretion of the development team.}}}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{Music Producers \& Sound Engineers (subsequently ``producers'')}}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Target subject matter knowledge:} description of current process and/or approach used to guide recording artists to explore or experiment with a new \textcolor{red}{sound}. For example, ``\emph{while recording, if I get an idea, I play a song with a specific cool feature (take tempo for example) and iteratively incorporate it into the current song being recorded, guiding the artist to adjust (e.g., incorporating a different cadence) across different attempts to incorporate the experimental feature}''.}} 
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Extent of project involvement:} minimal, i.e., no more than three interviews per producer.}}
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Influence on project:} moderate-low -- technology-keen producers may be more likely to already have a process into which \emph{GenreGuru} can be integrated, i.e., song featurization can quickly, and in large volumes, summarize music that the producer's target audience listens to, allowing the producer to better tailor their music output. Such a producer's insights can inform and guide development, but at the discretion of the development team.}}

    \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{Musicians}} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Target subject matter knowledge:} description of current process and/or approach used to generate novel ideas for unrecorded songs or experimenting with different ideas for already recorded songs. \emph{We must be cautious so as to only consider the experimentation component of the musician's workflow, not the music creation in its core.}}}
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Extent of project involvement:} minimal, i.e., no more than three interviews per musician.}} 
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Influence on project:} moderate -- like technology-keen producers, we suspect musicians may already have a process into which \emph{GenreGuru} can be integrated, i.e., song recommendation can quickly, and in large volumes, expose the musician to songs with desirable features as they explore how to create their own song. The musician's insights can inform and guide development, but again, at the discretion of the development team.}}

    \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{Music Theorists}}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Target subject matter knowledge:} description of current process and/or approach used to generate novel ideas for composing new songs or experimenting with different ideas for arranging existing songs. \emph{Yet again, we must be cautious so as to only consider the experimentation component of the theorist's workflow, not the composition or arrangement process in its core.}}}
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Extent of project involvement:} minimal, i.e., no more than three interviews per theorist -- \emph{though, we currently do not have any candidate music theorists.}}}
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Influence on project:} moderate-low -- music theorists may already have a process into which \emph{GenreGuru} can be integrated, similar to producers, i.e., song featurization can quickly, and in large volumes, summarize music from a catalogue of songs of interest to identify similarities and differences in their sound properties based on their composition and arrangement. At the discretion of the development team, the music theorist's insights can inform and guide development geared for very musically literate users.}}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{Music Educators}}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Target subject matter knowledge:} description of current process and/or approach used to introduce students to novel music concepts through experimentation or experimenting with different ideas for previously-learned (composite) concepts. \emph{We must be cautious so as to only consider the experimentation component of the teacher's workflow, not the teaching practice or philosophy in its core.}}}
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Extent of project involvement:} minimal, i.e., no more than three interviews per teacher -- \emph{though, we currently do not have any candidate music teachers.}}}
      \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\emph{Influence on project:} low -- music teachers may already have a process into which \emph{GenreGuru} can be integrated, i.e., song generation can (relatively) quickly, and in (relatively) large volumes, produce sound artifacts that introduce novel music concepts or demonstrate alternative use of one or more previously-learned concepts. Like other stakeholders, at the discretion of the development team, the music teacher's insights can inform and guide development geared for \emph{shared} music experimentation settings.}}

\end{itemize}


\noindent\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)}}\\
\textcolor{red}{Experts in music and audio analysis who can offer insights into effective recommendation practices while 
ensuring stakeholder privacy. For a commercial project, compliance with data protection regulations (such as PIPEDA) would be required.}\\
  
\noindent\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Music Producers \& Sound Engineers}}\\
\textcolor{red}{These stakeholders can use recommendations to quickly identify songs with similar production qualities or sonic characteristics, 
  aiding in benchmarking and creative decision-making. Their involvement will be minimal (e.g., up to three interviews) but valuable 
  for informing system integration into professional workflows.}\\
  
  \noindent\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Musicians}}\\
\textcolor{red}{Musicians can leverage the recommendation system to explore music that aligns with their style or inspires new creative directions. 
  As with producers, their feedback (via a few interviews) will help refine the system’s usability and relevance.}\\

  \noindent\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Music Theorists}}\\
\textcolor{red}{Although their direct involvement is expected to be minimal (e.g., up to three interviews), theorists can provide insights into how 
  the system might reveal relationships among songs based on shared musical structures or characteristics.}\\

  \noindent\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Music Educators}}\\
\textcolor{red}{Educators can utilize the recommendation system to expose students to a broader range of music with similar attributes, enhancing 
  learning and creative exploration. Their feedback will help tailor the system for educational purposes.}\\

  \noindent\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Affiliated Corporate and Label Staff}}\\
\textcolor{red}{These groups (including publishers, marketers, and studio managers) are acknowledged as potential external stakeholders but are
  considered out of scope for the current academic project.}\\

\noindent\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Music Regulators}}\\
\textcolor{red}{Regulatory bodies concerned with song licensing and data usage provide context for compliance when acquiring training data, though 
  these aspects are managed via API documentation and metadata dictionaries.}\\

\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
This section builds on \ref{2.4-hands-on-users}, appointing \emph{music producers} \& \emph{musicians} key users, then music theorists \& music educators secondary users. \textcolor{red}{\sout{These priorities may change as interviews are conducted and different user groups become more concrete.}}
\subsection{User Participation}
Further extending \ref{2.4-hands-on-users}, all users will be notified that they will be involved in no more than 3 interviews as mentioned in the extent of project involvement in \ref{2.3-other-stakeholders}. Should a user be willing to further contribute to the project after three interviews, they will be contacted as sparingly or generously as they outline. Asynchronous communication via e-mails and text are unrestricted, but expected to be within reason and not to cause a disturbance to its recipient.
\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
The maintenance team exclusively involves the team members, thus is considered out of scope and will not be explored in detail.

\section{Mandated Constraints}
\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{itemize}

  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{The service uses a music dataset}}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Rationale:} A dataset for an AI project is necessary as some form of training data must be used 
  in order to train the AI generative, analysis and recommendation systems. }}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The machine learning algorithms use a music dataset as the training set. }}

  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{The service uses a machine learning algorithm in order to generate song recommendations and snippets. }}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Rationale:} The general gist of this project is a leveraging of different signal processing and machine learning
  algorithms in order to provide an end user with a better experience for consuming music. We believe that using a machine 
  learning algorithm for these ends would both be interesting in terms of implementing and training a model, but also practically
  useful for the end user to provide better recommendations by leveraging training over a very large dataset in order to produce results. }}
  \\\textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The recommendation and generation components utilize trained machine learning algorithm. }}

  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{The service features integration with an existing music streaming provider's platform. }}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Rationale:} A music service provider (such as Spotify) would allow the service to bypass the need to have
  music inputted, instead being able to use references to a track. In addition, through API calls, providers such as spotify
  already have a large amount of useful labels for invidiual track(s) that can be used as features for the machine learning
  components of the service.  }}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The service has components that make uses of features (such as API calls) 
  that belong to a music service provider's platform. }}

  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{The service uses a server to process the user requests separately from the front end.}}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Rationale:} Ideally, our service would use an on-premise deployed ubuntu server in order to process the user 
  analysis, recommendation, and generation components of the project, as this would allow a more flexible front end design
  (such as through a web application). }}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Fit Criterion:} An on-premise server is deployed for the purposes of handling the analysis, generation and recommendations
  systems separately from the front end. }}


  \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Technology Stack}} \\
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Description:} The system shall be developed using a high-level programming language for efficient core processing 
  and a robust, secure language for backend logic, while the frontend will utilize modern web technologies (e.g., React and CSS) 
  for a responsive, intuitive interface.}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Rationale:} A high-level language on the backend enables rapid development and efficient handling of critical 
  processing tasks, and modern web technologies on the frontend ensure the interface is user-friendly, maintainable, and secure.}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The final product shall meet established performance benchmarks for processing tasks and deliver a responsive, 
  secure user interface across supported devices.}
  \\ \\

  \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Open-Source Libraries}} \\
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Description:} The app shall use open-source libraries and frameworks where applicable to save both time and money.}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Rationale:} Utilizing open-source libraries is cost-effective and leverages community-driven improvements and support.}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Fit Criterion:} All third-party libraries used in the project must be licensed under recognized open-source agreements
  (e.g., MIT, GPL, or Apache) to ensure they are free to use.}
  \\ \\

  \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Integration with a Music Streaming Provider’s Platform}} \\
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Description:} The service shall integrate with an existing music streaming provider’s platform.}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Rationale:} By integrating with a provider (such as Spotify, or Deezer), the service can use track references and 
  leverage existing metadata—eliminating the need to manually input music—and take advantage of the rich labels that 
  the provider supplies.}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The service must include components that successfully make API calls to a music streaming 
  provider’s platform to retrieve track features.}
  \\ \\

  \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Server-Based Processing of User Requests}} \\
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Description:} The service shall utilize a dedicated server to process user requests separately from the front end.}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Rationale:} Deploying an on-premise Ubuntu server for backend processing allows for flexible front-end design 
  (e.g., via a web application) while efficiently handling analysis, recommendations, and other processing tasks.}
  \\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Fit Criterion:} An on-premise server must be deployed to handle the backend processing, ensuring that 
  recommendation functions operate independently from the user interface.}
  \\ \\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
% \includegraphics[scale=0.552]{3_2_environment_diagram.pdf}

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Hardware Specifications}} \\
\\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Description:} The service shall run on a dedicated server with a minimum configuration of 8GB of RAM, 
a quad-core processor, and 256GB of available storage. The front-end interface will be accessible on standard personal 
computers or laptops (which include a keyboard, mouse, and speakers).}
\\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Rationale:} These specifications reflect the typical hardware available to our target users and 
ensure that both the backend processing and the user interface perform efficiently under normal operating conditions.}
\\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The system must pass performance tests on devices meeting these specifications.}
\\ \\

\noindent \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Software Environment}} \\
\\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Description:} The backend will be developed using a high-level programming language (e.g., Python) 
along with open-source libraries for efficient data processing. The frontend will be built with modern web technologies 
(e.g., React and CSS) to provide a responsive and intuitive user experience.}
\\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Rationale:} Using a proven, open-source software stack ensures rapid development, ease of maintenance, 
and robust integration between backend and frontend components while meeting industry standards for security and performance.}
\\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The final product shall demonstrate seamless integration between backend and frontend components 
and meet established performance benchmarks in processing speed and user interface responsiveness..}
\\ \\

\noindent \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Network and Integration}} \\
\\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Description:} The service shall operate over a stable internet connection to support real-time API communications 
with an external music streaming provider’s platform for up-to-date track metadata.}
\\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Rationale:} Reliable network connectivity is essential for maintaining real-time interactions and ensuring the 
system can access necessary external data sources to support its recommendation functionality.}
\\ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The system must achieve a network uptime of at least 99\% during continuous operation and 
successfully retrieve external data via API calls as verified through integration testing.}
\\ \\

\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
\includegraphics[scale=0.72]{3_3_partner_constraints_figure}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
There are several existing solutions that could serve as part of the music generation and recommendation system. These include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spotify API}: Provides access to a vast library of music, including song previews and metadata, which can be leveraged for generating recommendations.
    \item \textbf{Librosa Library}: An open-source Python package for analyzing and processing music files, suitable for extracting features from songs and facilitating generative components.
    \item \textbf{TensorFlow and PyTorch Pre-trained Models}: Both frameworks offer pre-trained models that could be adapted for music generation tasks. These solutions provide a basis for deep learning models without having to build and train from scratch.
    \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{OpenAI Jukebox}: A generative model that is capable of producing music, which could potentially be adapted and integrated into our system.}}
\end{itemize}

These off-the-shelf software solutions provide a foundation upon which we can build our custom features, significantly reducing the development time and leveraging existing technologies to enhance the functionality of our platform.

\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}

\textbf{Home Usage}\\
\\\textbf{Rationale:} This environment is more appropriate for casual music listeners. 
This means users will most likely be using it in a form of a casual environment. This can 
include such as during a public commute on the train, where the user might try to interact 
with the service while there is an unreliable internet connection on a mobile device. This
means the front end of the service must be easy to use and access on all types of devices, 
and preferrably, not a large amount of data is streamed between the user and the service. 
This means that preferrably, the input would have references to pieces of music instead of 
having say, full .MP3 files as the input. These users are also more likely interested in the 
recommendation system to attempt to find new pieces of music to listen to. \textcolor{red}{\sout{, and might be more
willing to use the generation system for "fun", so they might be satifisfied even with a 
generation component that produces odd results.}}
 \\ \\
\textbf{Studio Usage}
\\
\\\textbf{Rationale:}This environment is more professional and is most likely what creative professionals will be using. 
The expectation is that they will be using this on their computers, thus they are more likely to have a reliable internet 
connection in addition to being willing to input a large volume of music into the service. This means that the service needs 
to facilitate entering a large amount of music, and be able to \textcolor{red}{\sout{generate results in a rapid and efficient manner}} 
\textcolor{red}{produce accurate recommendations quickly}. Because the users of this type of environment would likely be individuals 
engaged in creative endeavors, they will generally have higher standards of what the service provides, and might be more interested in 
the \textcolor{red}{\sout{analysis component, such as being able to find new labels for their existing work to get new perspectives}} 
\textcolor{red}{recommendation functionality that efficiently surfaces new musical inspirations}. This also means that they most likely 
expect the \textcolor{red}{\sout{music generation component to give them something more "listenable", something they could directly use 
as a sample or inspiration}} \textcolor{red}{recommendations that are both relevant and innovative, providing inspiration for creative projects}.


\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
\textcolor{red}{\sout{This project was started in the 2024 Fall Term and is expected to be completed by the 
2025 winter term at McMaster university. Some of the key deadlines are: }}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan, November 11-22
  \\This deadline accounts for 5\% of the mark. The group should have identified the most significant
  risks involving the project and come up with plans on how to migitate said risks. If this is not possible, then the project 
  can be redefined. The group also needs to predict and note other concerns about potential problems or difficulties that could arise
  during development, such as testing difficulties or software portability. If this deadline is not met, then it means that our group
   does not fully understand the potential pitfalls of our project and we need to redefine certain aspects of the project. }}

  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{Final Demonstration, March 24-30
  \\This deadline accounts for 20\% of the mark. This deadline involves a demonstration of a finalized 
  version of the project to supervisors before the public EXPO happening at a TBD date. By this deadline, 
  the service should be in a completed state ready for use and demonstration. If this deadline is not met then
  the project can be considered a "failure". }}

  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{Final Documentation, April 2
  \\This deadline accounts for 30\% of the mark. It involves the finalized documentation of plans pertaining to 
  the project and the actual working program/service. Any final revisions and reflections pertaining to the project
  should have been completed by this deadline as no further changes to the project will be possible. Whatever documentation
  or code that is not completed by this deadline would be considered permanently unfinished. }}
\end{itemize}
\textcolor{red}{Schedule constraints are provided by the capstone course itself, for a detailed
schedule refer to the \href{https://github.com/AhmedAl-Hayali/GenreGuru/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan Document, section 8}.}

\subsection{Budget Constraints}
The budget limit as stated by the capstone outline is 750\$ CAD. Potential additional
costs might include API calls, software liscensing, account fees for cloud services. 
For the purposes of the demonstration they should not exceed the 750\$ limit. 

\subsection{Enterprise Constraints}
There are no specific enterprise constraints as we do not have outside investors
for this project. 

\section{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
\textcolor{red}{\emph{N/A.}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{Track is full song, i.e., a completed audio file published by a musician. }}

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
\textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Music Analysis Component}}}
\\\textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Manual Process}: Currently, this is usually manually done by the artist self-labelling their work
or third parties labelling the music. This can end up being time consuming. }}
\\\textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Automated Process}: Most automation on this regard (retrieving song information from a music 
provider's api) is mostly useful for retreiving already labelled information, there is not a lot of automation 
that is be done for labelling, but a lot that is possible retreiving said labels. }}
\\\textcolor{red}{\sout{What we wish to do with this component of the service is to gather and present said information that can be
gleamed from the music service provider's API to the user in a more presentable manner (such as audio visualizations)
  but also featurize an individual song for the other components in our service. Our service should also generate new
  labels using ML algorithms, which allows for faster automation of song labelling and more features for our other 
  components. }}
% \\\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{6_1_b.pdf}

\noindent\textbf{Music Recommendation Component}
\\\textbf{Manual Process}: Generally, this is mostly done through music curators should as DJs, playlist makers,
etc, where curators manually select songs and make recommendations based on popular trends, new artists releases,
or shifts in the genre. The main issue here is that it requires a large amount of manual work, as curators need to 
listen to new music before adding them to some form of playlist or recommending them to other people, which greatly
limits their potential recommendations. 
\\\textbf{Automated Process}: Most music service providers such as spotify, apple music or youtube already offer 
some form of music recommendation service use algorithms to recommend users new songs based on their listening history.
These generally already work decently well, but they end up usually being heavily weighted towards more popular songs 
(for example, sabrina carpenter's espresso being automatically recommended through smart shuffle no matter what your prior listening history was like), 
as record labels often have deals with these music service platforms so it is not unusual to get recommendations that 
do not necessarily suit the user's music tastes. 
\\The main benefit our service should provide is the ability to recommend songs that are more niche, more accurate based
on the user input while still using an automated system powered by machine learning, as we would have more features due 
to the analysis component for the ML algorithm to process, in addition to not being heavily weighted towards more popular,
trendy songs or some form of likely record label deals meddling. 
\\\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{6_1_a.pdf}

\noindent\textbf{Music Feature Extraction Component}
\\\textbf{Manual Process}: Currently, musical features are often determined manually by artists or third parties 
labeling the music. This process is time-consuming and can be inconsistent. 
\\\textbf{Automated Process}: Most existing solutions rely on retrieving pre-labeled metadata from music service providers’ APIs.
  However, there is limited automation in extracting detailed musical features directly from the audio. 
\\Our service will automate the extraction or featurization of key musical features. By doing so, we will provide users with clear 
and comprehensive feature data for each song. This feature extraction will serve as the foundation for generating accurate and personalized song recommendations.\\ 
\\\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{6_1b2.png}


\textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Music Generation Component}}}
\\\textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Manual Process}: Currently, generating music usually requires years of dedication to the craft and involves the
labour of musicians, producers, and composers. This means that there is a large amount of manpower that is necessary
in order to create new unique pieces. }}
\textcolor{red}{\sout{We wish to have our service provide a new avenue to generate new types of music. We do not envision this service as 
something that replaces the traditional music creation process, but rather as something that can potentially enhance it. }}

\section{Open Issues}
\textcolor{red}{\emph{N/A.}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{Generated output use regulation, \#1}}
  \\\textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Summary:} The service EULA agreement might need to consider how and where the generated snippet by the service is allowed
  to be used. }}
  
  \textcolor{red}{\sout{This is important because the training data or inputted track(s) into the service
  might have copyright laws \& rules regulating commerical use associated with them, thus we need to consider whether those rules \& regulations
   also apply with the generated snippet.  }}
  
  \textcolor{red}{\sout{For example, the EULA might need to state that generated snippets cannot be used for commercial purposes if the input contains song from a 
  specific artist belonging to some specific record label. This means that a creative professional's ability to actually use 
  this portion of the service could be greatly limited depending on what tracks they
  are inputting, and/or what the machine learning algorithm was trained on. }}

  \item\textcolor{red}{\sout{ Dataset Bias, \#2}}
  \\\textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Summary:} We are currently not exactly certain about what dataset we will be using for the algorithm training. 
  For example, if we are using some form of non-copyrighted music, there's a likely chance it is heavily biased towards electronic dance 
  music as a genre. This could skew the algorithm's ability to interact with music that is not of that genre, thus the service 
  might not be able to properly process requests users who perhaps listen to more niche genres of music. This means we might need to train the 
  machine learning algorithms on multiple different datasets, or we need to manually modify an existing dataset to integrate more niche genres 
  of music as the training source. }}

\section{New Problems}

\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}

\textcolor{red}{\sout{The platform's high computational requirements, especially during the training and usage of generative models, may put a strain on existing 
computational resources. This could lead to slower performance for other applications that share these resources. Additionally, increased data 
transmission due to the integration with APIs such as Spotify and Deezer could lead to higher network bandwidth utilization, potentially affecting 
the performance of other network-dependent systems. Mitigating these effects may require infrastructure scaling, such as increasing server capacity 
or optimizing data processing, to ensure that the existing systems are not disrupted.}}\\

\noindent\textcolor{red}{With the revised scope, the system’s computational load is significantly reduced because it no longer involves intensive generative modeling or 
in-depth audio analysis. However, relying heavily on external music provider APIs (e.g., Spotify and Deezer) for song data and snippets may increase 
network dependency. This could lead to performance bottlenecks if the external services experience latency or downtime. Additionally, although computational 
requirements are lower, the system must still handle potentially high volumes of recommendation requests, which may require improved load balancing on the server.}


\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}

\textcolor{red}{\sout{The new platform will interact with various installed systems, leading to the introduction of new dependencies. For example, using third-party 
APIs like Spotify or integrating machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow may require changes to the current software stack. These dependencies 
could introduce compatibility issues, particularly if third-party providers update their APIs or if new versions of required libraries are released. 
Such updates might necessitate timely system changes to maintain functionality and avoid disruptions. Ensuring that installed systems remain compatible 
requires diligent version management, comprehensive testing, and a structured process for managing library and API updates.}}\\

\noindent\textcolor{red}{The new recommendation system now integrates with external APIs and an internal database, rather than relying on custom-built generative models. 
This change reduces stress on local processing resources but introduces new dependencies on third-party API stability and compatibility. As external 
providers update their APIs or change data formats, our system might require timely adjustments to maintain functionality. Furthermore, integrating 
with the existing client interface and database now centers on efficient retrieval and display of recommendations rather than processing raw audio data.}


\subsection{Potential User Problems}

\textcolor{red}{\sout{The platform is designed to offer advanced features, which may present usability challenges for some users. For example, users with limited technical 
skills may struggle to understand the process of modifying musical features like key, rhythm, or tempo, which are essential for customizing music generation. 
Furthermore, the quality of generated outputs is inherently subjective, and users may feel frustrated if the system-generated music does not meet their expectations. 
Another potential problem is system latency, especially when resource-intensive operations like model inference are being performed. Long waiting times could negatively 
impact user experience, making the platform feel less responsive, which may deter regular use.}}\\

\noindent\textcolor{red}{Since the system now only provides recommendations, user problems may shift toward issues of relevance and clarity. For example, if the recommendation 
engine fails to consider a user’s context adequately, users might receive suggestions that do not align with their preferences. In addition, users might 
be confused if the recommendations are not clearly explained or if the interface does not provide intuitive feedback regarding how recommendations are derived.
 Although the computational complexity is reduced, latency in fetching data from external APIs could still impact the overall user experience, 
 particularly if network conditions are poor.}


\noindent\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}

\textcolor{red}{\sout{The platform is expected to be implemented on a local server, which presents certain limitations. The local server environment will need sufficient 
processing power to handle computationally intensive tasks, such as model training and music generation. If the server infrastructure is under-resourced, 
performance issues such as latency and reduced processing speed could arise. Additionally, reliance on a local server means that the platform's effectiveness 
is tied directly to server availability and maintenance. Any server downtime could render the platform inaccessible to users. If we decide to extend the platform's 
implementation onto personal devices, new limitations arise. Personal devices, especially those with limited hardware capabilities, may struggle with the computational 
requirements of generative music models, leading to significant performance bottlenecks. This could make the platform inaccessible or difficult to use for some users. 
Moreover, the reliance on internet connectivity for accessing external APIs is another major limitation. Users in areas with unreliable internet or low bandwidth may 
face difficulties, particularly with real-time features like music recommendations or generating new songs based on streaming data. These limitations could restrict 
the user base to only those with high-performance devices and stable internet connections.}}\\

\noindent\textcolor{red}{The reliance on external APIs introduces new limitations. Any changes in API rate limits, unexpected downtime, or shifts in available data could directly 
affect system performance. Furthermore, while the reduced computational load allows the system to run on less powerful hardware, it also means that network 
reliability becomes the primary constraint. Users in regions with low bandwidth or unreliable internet connections may experience delays in receiving recommendations.
 Finally, the centralized nature of the recommendation processing still requires a robust server environment to handle concurrent requests effectively.}


\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}

\textcolor{red}{\sout{Once the platform is deployed, several follow-up issues will need to be addressed to maintain and improve the product. One of the primary challenges will be 
keeping up with third-party API changes, such as modifications to Spotify or Deezer APIs, which could lead to broken features if not handled promptly. 
The generative models used by the platform will also require regular updates and retraining to stay relevant to emerging musical styles and user preferences.
 Another follow-up problem is related to usability: feedback from users might reveal unforeseen pain points or desired improvements. Addressing these concerns 
 will require an iterative development approach, incorporating user feedback into future versions of the platform to enhance usability and performance.}}\\

 \noindent\textcolor{red}{Post-deployment, the system will need ongoing monitoring of external API changes. The team must establish a process to rapidly adapt to updates from Spotify,
  Deezer, or other providers to prevent broken functionality. In addition, user feedback may reveal new issues—such as a need for more personalized recommendation 
  criteria or additional explanation of recommendation logic—that were not apparent during development. Periodic reviews of the recommendation algorithm may also
   be necessary to adjust parameters or incorporate new features as user preferences evolve. Lastly, ensuring seamless integration with evolving client interfaces 
   and maintaining data integrity within the database will remain continuous challenges.}

\section{User Documentation and Training}

\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}

% Original introduction text with changes:
The \textcolor{red}{\sout{music featurization feature}} \textcolor{red}{music recommendation feature} is heavily API-driven, and as such, detailed documentation will primarily be covered within the API reference section. This approach ensures that developers and advanced users can understand the feature's capabilities without needing additional user guides.

To ensure that users can effectively interact with the \textcolor{red}{\sout{music generation and recommendation platform}} \textcolor{red}{music recommendation platform}, the following user documentation will be provided:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Quick Start Guide}: A concise guide aimed at helping new users get started with the basics of \textcolor{red}{\sout{generating and }}recommending music.
  \item \textbf{API Reference and Technical Specifications}: Detailed documentation of the platform’s API, including available endpoints, request/response formats, and example queries. This reference is crucial for developers and advanced users who want to integrate the platform with other applications or automate tasks.
  \item \textbf{Installation Guide}: A step-by-step guide for installing the platform on local servers, including system requirements, installation commands, and troubleshooting common setup issues.
  \item \textbf{FAQs and Troubleshooting}: A list of frequently asked questions and troubleshooting tips to help users solve common issues independently.
  \item \textbf{Video Tutorials}: Step-by-step video guides that visually demonstrate key features and workflows, including setting up the platform, using the API, and \textcolor{red}{\sout{generating music}} \textcolor{red}{using the recommendation engine}.
\end{itemize}

These documents will be designed for users of varying technical backgrounds to ensure they can fully utilize the platform's capabilities. The documentation will be created and maintained primarily by the development team, ensuring accuracy and alignment with the latest platform features. However, feedback from user groups will be actively sought to improve clarity and address any documentation gaps. Updates to the API reference and technical specifications will be managed as part of the regular software update cycle.

\subsection{Training Requirements}

To provide users with sufficient knowledge to operate the platform effectively, the following training resources will be developed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Video Tutorials}: Developed by the development team, these tutorials will cover various aspects of the platform, including API usage, \textcolor{red}{\sout{generating music,}} and using the recommendation system.
  \item \textbf{Online Training Modules}: If additional resources become available, online training modules could be developed to provide users with a structured learning path. However, due to current resource constraints, we do not plan to offer live training sessions.
\end{itemize}

These training requirements aim to encourage users to explore the full potential of the platform, regardless of their prior experience in music production or technology.

\section{Waiting Room}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The recommendation system will be able to recommend songs from less popular music genres (jazz, blues, etc.).
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{The analysis system will be able to extract musical features from less popular music genres (jazz, blues, etc.).}}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{The generative system will be able to generate songs from less popular music genres (jazz, blues, etc.).}}
  \item The recommendation system will be able to recommend songs from unpopular music genres (gnawa, Libyan funk, etc.).
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{The analysis system will be able to extract musical features from less popular music genres (gnawa, Libyan funk, etc.).}}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{The generative system will be able to generate songs from less popular music genres (gnawa, Libyan funk, etc.).}}
  \item The recommendation system will be able to search for songs with cover art similar to an input song.
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{The generative system will be able to generate new cover art for a newly generated song, based on the user's input criteria.}}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{The generative system will be able to generate new cover art for an existing song.}}
  % New potential waiting room items can be inserted here if desired.
  \item \textcolor{red}{The recommendation system will incorporate user feedback to improve song suggestion relevance over time.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Ideas for Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Recommendation System}: A hybrid recommendation system combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to provide a more personalized experience for users. Content-based filtering analyzes song features, such as genre, key, and rhythm, to suggest similar tracks. Collaborative filtering uses user preferences and historical listening patterns to suggest music. By combining these approaches, the system can offer users personalized suggestions while also helping them discover new genres and music styles.
    
    \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Generative Music Model}: To enable the creation of new music, a generative model will be used. This model could be based on techniques such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A GAN would allow for the generation of realistic music by having the generator and discriminator work together to produce convincing compositions. An RNN, on the other hand, would be well-suited for learning the sequential nature of music, generating new melodies based on learned patterns. This solution provides users with an innovative way to create new music based on their inputs and preferences.}}
    
    \item \textcolor{red}{\sout{\textbf{Feature Manipulation Interface}: This interface will allow users to interact directly with song features, such as tempo, key, and rhythm, enabling them to create customized versions of existing tracks or generate entirely new compositions. By adjusting different musical parameters, users can personalize their musical experience and experiment with creative variations, providing a high level of control over the output.}}
    
    \item \textbf{Integration with Existing Platforms}: Integrating the system with existing music platforms, such as Spotify, will allow users to easily access and analyze a large library of songs. Users will be able to input their favorite tracks from these platforms and receive recommendations. This integration ensures a smooth user experience, allowing seamless interaction between existing music libraries and the recommendation engine.
    
    % If there are additional new ideas, you can add them here.
    \item \textcolor{red}{User Preference Neural Network: Develop a model that learns from user interactions to weight different audio features, thereby improving recommendation personalization.}
\end{itemize}
