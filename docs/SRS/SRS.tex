\section{User Documentation and Training}

\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}

The music featurization feature is heavily API-driven, and as such, detailed documentation will primarily be covered within the API reference section. This approach ensures that developers and advanced users can understand the feature's capabilities without needing additional user guides.

To ensure that users can effectively interact with the music generation and recommendation platform, the following user documentation will be provided:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Quick Start Guide}: A concise guide aimed at helping new users get started with the basics of generating and recommending music.
  \item \textbf{API Reference and Technical Specifications}: Detailed documentation of the platformâ€™s API, including available endpoints, request/response formats, and example queries. This reference is crucial for developers and advanced users who want to integrate the platform with other applications or automate tasks.
  \item \textbf{Installation Guide}: A step-by-step guide for installing the platform on local servers, including system requirements, installation commands, and troubleshooting common setup issues.
  \item \textbf{FAQs and Troubleshooting}: A list of frequently asked questions and troubleshooting tips to help users solve common issues independently.
  \item \textbf{Video Tutorials}: Step-by-step video guides that visually demonstrate key features and workflows, including setting up the platform, using the API, and generating music.
\end{itemize}

These documents will be designed for users of varying technical backgrounds to ensure they can fully utilize the platform's capabilities. The documentation will be created and maintained primarily by the development team, ensuring accuracy and alignment with the latest platform features. However, feedback from user groups will be actively sought to improve clarity and address any documentation gaps. Updates to the API reference and technical specifications will be managed as part of the regular software update cycle.
\subsection{Training Requirements}

To provide users with sufficient knowledge to operate the platform effectively, the following training resources will be developed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Video Tutorials}: Developed by the development team, these tutorials will cover various aspects of the platform, including API usage, generating music, and using advanced features. 
  \item \textbf{Online Training Modules}: If additional resources become available, online training modules could be developed to provide users with a structured learning path. However, due to current resource constraints, we do not plan to offer live training sessions.
\end{itemize}

These training requirements aim to encourage users to explore the full potential of the platform, regardless of their prior experience in music production or technology.


\section{Waiting Room}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The recommendation system will be able to recommend songs from less popular music genres (jazz, blues, etc.)
  \item The analysis system will be able to extract musical features from less popular music genres (jazz, blues, etc.)
  \item The generative system will be able to generate songs from less popular music genres (jazz, blues, etc.)
  \item The recommendation system will be able to recommend songs from unpopular music genres (gnawa, libyan funk, etc.)
  \item The analysis system will be able to extract musical features from less popular music genres (gnawa, libyan funk, etc.)
  \item The generative system will be able to generate songs from less popular music genres (gnawa, libyan funk, etc.)
  \item The recommendation system will be able to search for songs with cover art similar to an input song
  \item The generative system will be able to generate new cover art for a newly generated song, based on the user's
  input criteria
  \item The generative system will be able to generate new covert art for an existing song
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ideas for Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Recommendation System}: 
    A hybrid recommendation system combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to provide a more personalized experience for users. Content-based filtering analyzes song features, such as genre, key, and rhythm, to suggest similar tracks. Collaborative filtering uses user preferences and historical listening patterns to suggest music. By combining these approaches, the system can offer users personalized suggestions while also helping them discover new genres and music styles.

    \item \textbf{Generative Music Model}: 
    To enable the creation of new music, a generative model will be used. This model could be based on techniques such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A GAN would allow for the generation of realistic music by having the generator and discriminator work together to produce convincing compositions. An RNN, on the other hand, would be well-suited for learning the sequential nature of music, generating new melodies based on learned patterns. This solution provides users with an innovative way to create new music based on their inputs and preferences.

    \item \textbf{Feature Manipulation Interface}: 
    This interface will allow users to interact directly with song features, such as tempo, key, and rhythm, enabling them to create customized versions of existing tracks or generate entirely new compositions. By adjusting different musical parameters, users can personalize their musical experience and experiment with creative variations, providing a high level of control over the output.

    \item \textbf{Integration with Existing Platforms}: 
    Integrating the system with existing music platforms, such as Spotify, will allow users to easily access and analyze a large library of songs. Users will be able to input their favorite tracks from these platforms and generate variations or receive recommendations. This integration ensures a smooth user experience, allowing seamless interaction between existing music libraries and the platform's generative capabilities.

\end{itemize}
