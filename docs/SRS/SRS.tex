\section{New Problems}

\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}

The platform's high computational requirements, especially during the training and usage of generative models, may put a strain on existing computational resources. This could lead to slower performance for other applications that share these resources. Additionally, increased data transmission due to the integration with APIs such as Spotify and Deezer could lead to higher network bandwidth utilization, potentially affecting the performance of other network-dependent systems. Mitigating these effects may require infrastructure scaling, such as increasing server capacity or optimizing data processing, to ensure that the existing systems are not disrupted.

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}

The new platform will interact with various installed systems, leading to the introduction of new dependencies. For example, using third-party APIs like Spotify or integrating machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow may require changes to the current software stack. These dependencies could introduce compatibility issues, particularly if third-party providers update their APIs or if new versions of required libraries are released. Such updates might necessitate timely system changes to maintain functionality and avoid disruptions. Ensuring that installed systems remain compatible requires diligent version management, comprehensive testing, and a structured process for managing library and API updates.

\subsection{Potential User Problems}

The platform is designed to offer advanced features, which may present usability challenges for some users. For example, users with limited technical skills may struggle to understand the process of modifying musical features like key, rhythm, or tempo, which are essential for customizing music generation. Furthermore, the quality of generated outputs is inherently subjective, and users may feel frustrated if the system-generated music does not meet their expectations. Another potential problem is system latency, especially when resource-intensive operations like model inference are being performed. Long waiting times could negatively impact user experience, making the platform feel less responsive, which may deter regular use.

\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment}

The platform is expected to be implemented on a local server, which presents certain limitations. The local server environment will need sufficient processing power to handle computationally intensive tasks, such as model training and music generation. If the server infrastructure is under-resourced, performance issues such as latency and reduced processing speed could arise. Additionally, reliance on a local server means that the platform's effectiveness is tied directly to server availability and maintenance. Any server downtime could render the platform inaccessible to users. If we decide to extend the platform's implementation onto personal devices, new limitations arise. Personal devices, especially those with limited hardware capabilities, may struggle with the computational requirements of generative music models, leading to significant performance bottlenecks. This could make the platform inaccessible or difficult to use for some users. Moreover, the reliance on internet connectivity for accessing external APIs is another major limitation. Users in areas with unreliable internet or low bandwidth may face difficulties, particularly with real-time features like music recommendations or generating new songs based on streaming data. These limitations could restrict the user base to only those with high-performance devices and stable internet connections.

\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}

Once the platform is deployed, several follow-up issues will need to be addressed to maintain and improve the product. One of the primary challenges will be keeping up with third-party API changes, such as modifications to Spotify or Deezer APIs, which could lead to broken features if not handled promptly. The generative models used by the platform will also require regular updates and retraining to stay relevant to emerging musical styles and user preferences. Another follow-up problem is related to usability: feedback from users might reveal unforeseen pain points or desired improvements. Addressing these concerns will require an iterative development approach, incorporating user feedback into future versions of the platform to enhance usability and performance.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
