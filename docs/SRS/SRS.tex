\section{Mandated Constraints}
\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{itemize}

  \item The service uses a music dataset
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} A dataset for an AI project is necessary as some form of training data must be used 
  in order to train the AI generative, analysis and recommendation systems. 
  \\ \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The machine learning algorithms use a music dataset as the training set. 

  \item The service uses a machine learning algorithm in order to generate song recommendations and snippets. 
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The general gist of this project is a leveraging of different signal processing and machine learning
  algorithms in order to provide an end user with a better experience for consuming music. We believe that using a machine 
  learning algorithm for these ends would both be interesting in terms of implementing and training a model, but also practically
  useful for the end user to provide better recommendations by leveraging training over a very large dataset in order to produce results. 
  \\\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The recommendation and generation components utilize trained machine learning algorithm. 

  \item The service features integration with an existing music streaming provider's platform. 
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} A music service provider (such as Spotify) would allow the service to bypass the need to have
  music inputted, instead being able to use references to a track. In addition, through API calls, providers such as spotify
  already have a large amount of useful labels for invidiual track(s) that can be used as features for the machine learning
  components of the service.  
  \\ \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The service has components that make uses of features (such as API calls) 
  that belong to a music service provider's platform. 

  \item The service uses a server to process the user requests separately from the front end.
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Ideally, our service would use an on-premise deployed ubuntu server in order to process the user 
  analysis, recommendation, and generation components of the project, as this would allow a more flexible front end design
  (such as through a web application). 
  \\ \textbf{Fit Criterion:} An on-premise server is deployed for the purposes of handling the analysis, generation and recommendations
  systems separately from the front end. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cloud Hosting Infrastructure
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Cloud hosting can allow the service to remotely store user and service information, in addition to AI machine learning 
  features.

  \item Computational Resources Available for the Service/Hardware Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The computational resources accessible for both the training and service provision to the user must be considered. 
  This can include, but is not limited to how powerful the CPU, GPU that can be used to train the machine learning model and what level of
  computational power the end user has on hand determines how much resources the services can use to give the user their desired results. 

  \item Storage/Database Systems
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} How the training data and user data is trained are both very important considerations. This can include both using some form
  of a cloud storage or local database. 

  \item Network Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The system will likely require a fast, high-bandwidth internet connections because the user is expected to upload music or references 
  to said music before the service responds to the user request. This means an efficient method of allowing users to upload said references is 
  important, as the user uploading entire music files might greatly reduce the amount of music that can be fed into the final service (as some
  of said music files would likely be illegally obtained) and would require uploading far too much data, thus slowing the entire process down.

  \item External Resources Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The service will most likely have to access an external API, such as spotify's, which already includes a lot of 
  useful information that can be provided for the service in order to function. Whether these are available or not, or how expensive the API
  calls actually are can greatly affect the viability of certain aspects of the project. This also includes open source music data sets for
  a machine learning project, it is possible those sets only contain a certain type of music (such as electronic) and does not feature a lot of
  hip hop, which can prevent the service from effectively engaging with certain types of sound or genre. 

  \item Security Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Security protocols to protect a potential remote server the service employs and preventing unauthorized access to 
  user data are both potentially very important elements of the service that need to be considered. 

  \item Liscensing Constraints 
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Currently, there is an ongoing debate over whether AI generation, especially related to art, can be considered 
  as plagiarism or intellectual properthy theft. If the machine learning components of the service is trained on music from a large artist 
  that does not approve of the end project, it is possible that there would be some form of legal consequences, thus the selection of 
  trianing data and what songs the user is allowed to input into the final model needs to be seriously considered. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
There are several existing solutions that could serve as part of the music generation and recommendation system. These include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spotify API}: Provides access to a vast library of music, including song previews and metadata, which can be leveraged for generating recommendations.
    \item \textbf{Librosa Library}: An open-source Python package for analyzing and processing music files, suitable for extracting features from songs and facilitating generative components.
    \item \textbf{TensorFlow and PyTorch Pre-trained Models}: Both frameworks offer pre-trained models that could be adapted for music generation tasks. These solutions provide a basis for deep learning models without having to build and train from scratch.
    \item \textbf{OpenAI Jukebox}: A generative model that is capable of producing music, which could potentially be adapted and integrated into our system.
\end{itemize}

These off-the-shelf software solutions provide a foundation upon which we can build our custom features, significantly reducing the development time and leveraging existing technologies to enhance the functionality of our platform.

\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Home Usage
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} This environment is more appropriate for casual music listeners. 
  This means users will most likely be using it in a form of a casual environment, such as their phone.
  This means that uploading songs and snippets must be easy and convenient on a mobile device, such 
  as being able to directly input a spotify platlist. 

  \item Studio Usage
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} This environment is more professional and what is most likely what 
  creative professionals will be using. The expectation is that they will be using this on their 
  computers, thus they are more likely have a reliable internet connection in addition to being
  willing to input a lot more music to the service. T

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
This project was started in the 2024 Fall Term and is expected to be completed by the 
2025 winter term at McMaster university. Some of the key deadlines are: \\
Proof of concept, November 11-22nd\\
Final demonstraintion, March 24-30th\\
Final Documentation, April 2\\

\subsection{Budget Constraints}
The budget limit as stated by the capstone outline is 750\$ CAD. Potential additional
costs might include API calls, software liscensing, account fees for cloud services. 
For the purposes of the demonstration they should not exceed the 750\$ limit. 

\subsection{Enterprise Constraints}
There are no specific enterprise constraints as we do not have outside investors
for this project.

\section{Ideas for Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Recommendation System}: 
    A hybrid recommendation system combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to provide a more personalized experience for users. Content-based filtering analyzes song features, such as genre, key, and rhythm, to suggest similar tracks. Collaborative filtering uses user preferences and historical listening patterns to suggest music. By combining these approaches, the system can offer users personalized suggestions while also helping them discover new genres and music styles.

    \item \textbf{Generative Music Model}: 
    To enable the creation of new music, a generative model will be used. This model could be based on techniques such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A GAN would allow for the generation of realistic music by having the generator and discriminator work together to produce convincing compositions. An RNN, on the other hand, would be well-suited for learning the sequential nature of music, generating new melodies based on learned patterns. This solution provides users with an innovative way to create new music based on their inputs and preferences.

    \item \textbf{Feature Manipulation Interface}: 
    This interface will allow users to interact directly with song features, such as tempo, key, and rhythm, enabling them to create customized versions of existing tracks or generate entirely new compositions. By adjusting different musical parameters, users can personalize their musical experience and experiment with creative variations, providing a high level of control over the output.

    \item \textbf{Integration with Existing Platforms}: 
    Integrating the system with existing music platforms, such as Spotify, will allow users to easily access and analyze a large library of songs. Users will be able to input their favorite tracks from these platforms and generate variations or receive recommendations. This integration ensures a smooth user experience, allowing seamless interaction between existing music libraries and the platform's generative capabilities.
