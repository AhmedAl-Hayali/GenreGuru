\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}


There are several existing solutions that could serve as part of the music generation and recommendation system. These include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spotify API}: Provides access to a vast library of music, including song previews and metadata, which can be leveraged for generating recommendations.
    \item \textbf{Librosa Library}: An open-source Python package for analyzing and processing music files, suitable for extracting features from songs and facilitating generative components.
    \item \textbf{TensorFlow and PyTorch Pre-trained Models}: Both frameworks offer pre-trained models that could be adapted for music generation tasks. These solutions provide a basis for deep learning models without having to build and train from scratch.
    \item \textbf{OpenAI Jukebox}: A generative model that is capable of producing music, which could potentially be adapted and integrated into our system.
\end{itemize}

These off-the-shelf software solutions provide a foundation upon which we can build our custom features, significantly reducing the development time and leveraging existing technologies to enhance the functionality of our platform.

\section{Relevant Facts And Assumptions}
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Existing music recommendation algorithms are limited in customization
  and accuracy
  \item Current generative models struggle to match the quality of human-produced music
  \item The output of current generative models is unpredicatble
  \item Existing audio analysis tools provide a strong foundation that can be expanded upon
  \item The system will rely on external APIs to gather data on musical features
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Business Rules}
This section will list out the high-level functionality of the project
\begin{itemize}
  \item The project will contain a generative system that will use a machine learning model 
  to generate music aligning with a user's input critera
  \item The project will contain an analysis system that will extract musical features
  from a user's input song
  \item The project will contain a recommendation system that will recommend songs to the user
  that match the user's input critera
  \item the user will interact with the project through a website
  \item the website will communicate with a locally deployed server
  \item the server will handle the large datasets and machine learning models implemented in the project
  \item the user will interact with the generative system by typing in various musical features they wish
  to be generated
  \item the user will interact with the analysis system by providing either a song file or a link to a video
  containing the song they wish to analyze
  \item the user will interact with the recommendation system by tuping in various musical features they wish
  to experience in the recommended songs
  \item the generative system will return and display multiple song files to the user, with the ability to both play them directly
  in their browser and download the song to their computer
  \item the recommendation system will return and display a list of songs and their links to the user
  \item the analysis system will return and display a list of musical features to the user
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Users will have at least some familiarity of music theory
  \item The analysis and recommendation systems will use as many well-established musical 
  features as possible
  \item All API inputs will be easily accessible and reliable enough to support the
  recommendation and analysis systems
  \item The system will be written in a language that all developers are familiar with
  \item The system will use a local server to handle the processing of
  the machine learning model and large datasets
  \item Handling of niche features and cover art are designed to enhance the user experience, but 
  these will not be a part of the core functionality of the system
  \item The generative system will be completed by the POC demo date
  \item The recommendation and analysis systems will be completed by the Revision 0 date
\end{itemize}

\section{Ideas for Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Recommendation System}: 
    A hybrid recommendation system combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to provide a more personalized experience for users. Content-based filtering analyzes song features, such as genre, key, and rhythm, to suggest similar tracks. Collaborative filtering uses user preferences and historical listening patterns to suggest music. By combining these approaches, the system can offer users personalized suggestions while also helping them discover new genres and music styles.

    \item \textbf{Generative Music Model}: 
    To enable the creation of new music, a generative model will be used. This model could be based on techniques such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A GAN would allow for the generation of realistic music by having the generator and discriminator work together to produce convincing compositions. An RNN, on the other hand, would be well-suited for learning the sequential nature of music, generating new melodies based on learned patterns. This solution provides users with an innovative way to create new music based on their inputs and preferences.

    \item \textbf{Feature Manipulation Interface}: 
    This interface will allow users to interact directly with song features, such as tempo, key, and rhythm, enabling them to create customized versions of existing tracks or generate entirely new compositions. By adjusting different musical parameters, users can personalize their musical experience and experiment with creative variations, providing a high level of control over the output.

    \item \textbf{Integration with Existing Platforms}: 
    Integrating the system with existing music platforms, such as Spotify, will allow users to easily access and analyze a large library of songs. Users will be able to input their favorite tracks from these platforms and generate variations or receive recommendations. This integration ensures a smooth user experience, allowing seamless interaction between existing music libraries and the platform's generative capabilities.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
