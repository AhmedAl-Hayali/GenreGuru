\section{Mandated Constraints}
\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Constraint
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} 
  \\ \textbf{Fit Criterion:} 

  \item The Service shall handle user interaction through a web application.
  \\\textbf{Rationale}: allows for users to access the service through any device with an internet connection
  \\\textbf{Fit Criterion}: the web application functions correctly on both a mobile phone browser and PC. 

  \item The service uses a music dataset, such as openAI's jukebox dataset. 
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} A dataset for an AI project is necessary as some form of training data must be used 
  in order to train the AI generative, analysis and recommendation systems. 
  \\ \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The system uses a music dataset as the training source. 

  \item The service uses a cloud infrastructure for computations.
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The cloud infrastructure is scalable and allows for computation for the AI portions
  of the project to not be done locally. 
  \\ \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The system must be deployed on a form of a cloud platform (such as AWS), and utilize the platform for some features
  such as the machine learning components. 

  \item The service uses a modern database system. 
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} A database system would allow the service to store user data, song metadata, it can act like a pseudo-cache for performance. 
  \\ \textbf{Fit Criterion:} A database that stores music metadata must be deployed. 
  

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cloud Hosting Infrastructure
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Cloud hosting can allow the service to remotely store user and service information, in addition to AI machine learning 
  features.

  \item Computational Resources Available for the Service/Hardware Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The computational resources accessible for both the training and service provision to the user must be considered. 
  This can include, but is not limited to how powerful the CPU, GPU that can be used to train the machine learning model and what level of
  computational power the end user has on hand determines how much resources the services can use to give the user their desired results. 

  \item Storage/Database Systems
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} How the training data and user data is trained are both very important considerations. This can include both using some form
  of a cloud storage or local database. 

  \item Network Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The system will likely require a fast, high-bandwidth internet connections because the user is expected to upload music or references 
  to said music before the service responds to the user request. This means an efficient method of allowing users to upload said references is 
  important, as the user uploading entire music files might greatly reduce the amount of music that can be fed into the final service (as some
  of said music files would likely be illegally obtained) and would require uploading far too much data, thus slowing the entire process down.

  \item External Resources Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The service will most likely have to access an external API, such as spotify's, which already includes a lot of 
  useful information that can be provided for the service in order to function. Whether these are available or not, or how expensive the API
  calls actually are can greatly affect the viability of certain aspects of the project. This also includes open source music data sets for
  a machine learning project, it is possible those sets only contain a certain type of music (such as electronic) and does not feature a lot of
  hip hop, which can prevent the service from effectively engaging with certain types of sound or genre. 

  \item Security Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Security protocols to protect a potential remote server the service employs and preventing unauthorized access to 
  user data are both potentially very important elements of the service that need to be considered. 

  \item Liscensing Constraints 
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Currently, there is an ongoing debate over whether AI generation, especially related to art, can be considered 
  as plagiarism or intellectual properthy theft. If the machine learning components of the service is trained on music from a large artist 
  that does not approve of the end project, it is possible that there would be some form of legal consequences, thus the selection of 
  trianing data and what songs the user is allowed to input into the final model needs to be seriously considered. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Music-related AI machine learning model
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Using an off the shelf that is manually trained and then retuned
  for our purposes or given additional features that weren't included by default. This is largely
  so that some of the groundwork can already be done, making the project significantly more
  feasible. 

  \item Music Provider API services 
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Using a music service provider's API such as spotify's would 
  greatly simplify the work that needs to be done as these services already offer a lot of useful
  information, such as song features (danceability, popularity, etc) that can be used as 
  features for the machine learning model. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Home Usage
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} This environment is more appropriate for casual music listeners. 
  This means users will most likely be using it in a form of a casual environment, such as their phone.
  This means that uploading songs and snippets must be easy and convenient on a mobile device, such 
  as being able to directly input a spotify platlist. 

  \item Studio Usage
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} This environment is more professional and what is most likely what 
  creative professionals will be using. The expectation is that they will be using this on their 
  computers, thus they are more likely have a reliable internet connection in addition to being
  willing to input a lot more music to the service. T

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
This project was started in the 2024 Fall Term and is expected to be completed by the 
2025 winter term at McMaster university. Some of the key deadlines are: \\
Proof of concept, November 11-22nd\\
Final demonstraintion, March 24-30th\\
Final Documentation, April 2\\

\subsection{Budget Constraints}
The budget limit as stated by the capstone outline is 750\$ CAD. Potential additional
costs might include API calls, software liscensing, account fees for cloud services. 
For the purposes of the demonstration they should not exceed the 750\$ limit. 

\subsection{Enterprise Constraints}
There are no specific enterprise constraints as we do not have outside investors
for this project.
