\section{Mandated Constraints}
\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Constraint
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} 
  \\ \textbf{Fit Criterion:} 

  \item The Service shall handle user interaction through a web application.
  \\\textbf{Rationale}: allows for users to access the service through any device with an internet connection
  \\\textbf{Fit Criterion}: the web application functions correctly on both a mobile phone browser and PC. 

  \item The service uses a music dataset, such as openAI's jukebox dataset. 
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} A dataset for an AI project is necessary as some form of training data must be used 
  in order to train the AI generative, analysis and recommendation systems. 
  \\ \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The system uses a music dataset as the training source. 

  \item The service uses a cloud infrastructure for computations.
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The cloud infrastructure is scalable and allows for computation for the AI portions
  of the project to not be done locally. 
  \\ \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The system must be deployed on a form of a cloud platform (such as AWS), and utilize the platform for some features
  such as the machine learning components. 

  \item The service uses a modern database system. 
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} A database system would allow the service to store user data, song metadata, it can act like a pseudo-cache for performance. 
  \\ \textbf{Fit Criterion:} A database that stores music metadata must be deployed. 
  

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cloud Hosting Infrastructure
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Cloud hosting can allow the service to remotely store user and service information, in addition to AI machine learning 
  features.

  \item Computational Resources Available for the Service/Hardware Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The computational resources accessible for both the training and service provision to the user must be considered. 
  This can include, but is not limited to how powerful the CPU, GPU that can be used to train the machine learning model and what level of
  computational power the end user has on hand determines how much resources the services can use to give the user their desired results. 

  \item Storage/Database Systems
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} How the training data and user data is trained are both very important considerations. This can include both using some form
  of a cloud storage or local database. 

  \item Network Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The system will likely require a fast, high-bandwidth internet connections because the user is expected to upload music or references 
  to said music before the service responds to the user request. This means an efficient method of allowing users to upload said references is 
  important, as the user uploading entire music files might greatly reduce the amount of music that can be fed into the final service (as some
  of said music files would likely be illegally obtained) and would require uploading far too much data, thus slowing the entire process down.

  \item External Resources Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} The service will most likely have to access an external API, such as spotify's, which already includes a lot of 
  useful information that can be provided for the service in order to function. Whether these are available or not, or how expensive the API
  calls actually are can greatly affect the viability of certain aspects of the project. This also includes open source music data sets for
  a machine learning project, it is possible those sets only contain a certain type of music (such as electronic) and does not feature a lot of
  hip hop, which can prevent the service from effectively engaging with certain types of sound or genre. 

  \item Security Constraints
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Security protocols to protect a potential remote server the service employs and preventing unauthorized access to 
  user data are both potentially very important elements of the service that need to be considered. 

  \item Liscensing Constraints 
  \\ \textbf{Rationale:} Currently, there is an ongoing debate over whether AI generation, especially related to art, can be considered 
  as plagiarism or intellectual properthy theft. If the machine learning components of the service is trained on music from a large artist 
  that does not approve of the end project, it is possible that there would be some form of legal consequences, thus the selection of 
  trianing data and what songs the user is allowed to input into the final model needs to be seriously considered.

graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
